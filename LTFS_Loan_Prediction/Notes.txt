- Build as many features as possible 
- Tree models are robust to outliers
- Tree models doesnt need standardization
- Try both numbers as well as ratios based on problem
- Try building simple categories from continuous variables if possible
- Try including more iterations with more rounds for overfitting detector
- Try including original features as well as dervied ones because tree based models will take care of correlations
- Save each fold result of kfold crossvalidation into a list/dataframe and take the mean of all the folds results and use it for submission
